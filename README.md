# Auto Birthday Celebrator
## Overview
Hello everyone! I'm Mert, and today is Day 32 of my "100 Days of Python" challenge. In this project, I've developed an Auto Birthday Celebrator using Python that sends personalized birthday emails.

## Project Description
The Auto Birthday Celebrator automatically sends birthday emails to individuals in a dataset using randomly selected letter templates. It reads birthday data from a CSV file, selects a random letter template, personalizes it, and sends the email to the birthday person.

## How to Run
To use the Auto Birthday Celebrator, follow these steps:

* Open the Python script: `main.py`
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
* Fill in your email and password in the script.
* Ensure that you have a CSV file named birthdays.csv with the birthday data.
* Customize the letter templates in the letter_templates folder.
* Run the script to automatically send birthday emails.
* Alternatively, you can set daily tasks and make them automatic by installing this programme at https://www.pythonanywhere.com/.

Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

## Project Files
* main.py: The main Python script for the Auto Birthday Celebrator.
* birthdays.csv: The CSV file containing birthday data.
* letter_templates: Folder containing letter templates.
## Getting Started
* Fill in your email and password in the Python script.
* Customize the letter templates in the letter_templates folder.
* Run the script to automatically send personalized birthday emails.
## Used Libraries
The following Python libraries were used in this project:

* random: For selecting random letter templates.
* smtplib: For sending emails.
* datetime: For getting the current date.
* pandas: For reading birthday data from the CSV file.
  
## Educational Insights
This project provides hands-on experience with key Python concepts:

* File Handling: Reading data from a CSV file.
* Randomization: Selecting random elements (letter templates) from a set.
* Email Sending: Using smtplib to send personalized birthday emails.
* Data Personalization: Modifying the content of a letter template based on individual data.

## Conclusion
I hope you find the Auto Birthday Celebrator helpful for automating birthday celebrations! It's been a great journey reaching Day 32, and I'm excited to continue exploring and learning. Happy coding!
